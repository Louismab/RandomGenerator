PPRICING OF BERMUDAN BASKET OPTIONS - NUMERICAL FINANCE PROJECT

SCOPE : The goal of this project is to price a Bermudan Basket Option using Monte Carlo simulation, and combine several variance reduction methods in order to reach a minimal simulation variance. The underlying diffusion is assumed to be a multi-dimensional Black-Scholes diffusion

The project can be implemented either in C++ or Python
- A main program must define and control the parameters to use, then call different Classes to perform the simulation
- The projectâ€™s architecture is free, and its design will particularly be appreciated.
- The program must be fully commented and parameters must be checked for consistency.

In addition to your program, you must also produce a User Guide PDF file that :
- Explains the modifiable variables in the main function
- Illustrates your results for different sets of inputs through graphs and tables
- Details your analysis and comments
